        <p>Game Sense in Rocket League is your ability to read the field, predict plays, and make smart decisions.
            It’s not about how flashy your mechanics are — it’s about being in the right place at the right time.
            Good Game Sense means knowing when to challenge, when to rotate back, when to pass, and when to trust your teammates.</p>
        <p>Mastering it is what separates great players from pro players.</p>

            <h3>Duos Rotations</h3>
            <p><b>First Player (Attack/Challenge): </b> up to pressure the ball or take the shot. If the play doesn't develop quickly, rotate out immediately.</p>
            <p><b>Second Player (Support/Cover): </b>Stay slightly behind or to the side to back up challenges, intercept clears, and prepare for counterattacks.</p>
            <p><b>Rotation Out: </b>After challenging or shooting, rotate back through midfield or along the side to allow your teammate to move up safely.</p>
            <p><b>Avoid Double Commitments: </b>, fast communication (or predictive positioning) prevents costly double challenges.</p>
            <p><b>Shadow Defense: </b> rotating back, stay between the ball and your goal to buy time and force bad plays from opponents.</p>

            <h3>Threes Rotations</h3>
            <p><b>First Player (Attack): </b> the ball aggressively or take shots when opportunities appear. After the play, rotate out wide to midfield or back post.</p>
            <p><b>Second Player (Support/Midfield): </b> around midfield to react quickly — either follow up on a play, cut off clears, or reset defense if needed.</p>
            <p><b>Third Player (Anchor/Defense): </b> back as the safety net. Ready to defend clears, save shots, or transition back into attack once your team regains control.</p>
            <p><b>Rotation Order: </b> attacking, move out and let teammates move up. Think "one goes, one stays, one covers."</p>
            <p><b>Avoid Overstacking: </b> out across the field to create passing options and prevent teammates from getting in each other's way.</p>
