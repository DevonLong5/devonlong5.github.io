            <h3>Half Flip</h3>
            <p><b>What it is: </b>A way to quickly turn around and start driving the opposite direction.</p>
            <p><b>How it Works: </b>You backflip but cancel it halfway using your stick and boost, letting your car land facing forward again.</p>
            <p><b>Why it's useful: </b>Super fast recovery when you’re facing the wrong way.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>45 Degree Flick</h3>
            <p><b>What it is: </b>A powerful flick where you tilt your car 45 degrees during a dribble and flip.</p>
            <p><b>How it Works: </b>You diagonal flip while dribbling to launch the ball with both height and speed.</p>
            <p><b>Why it's useful: </b>Great for fast, hard-to-block shots over defenders.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Speed Flip</h3>
            <p><b>What it is: </b>The fastest way to move across the field using a super-optimized flip.</p>
            <p><b>How it Works: </b>You flip slightly diagonal forward, cancel the flip early, and boost throughout.</p>
            <p><b>Why it's useful: </b>Faster than a regular flip — ideal for kickoffs and fast rotations.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Flip Reset</h3>
            <p><b>What it is: </b>Gaining a second jump by touching all four wheels to the ball midair.</p>
            <p><b>How it Works: </b>While airborne, you land all wheels on the ball, then press jump again for an extra flip.</p>
            <p><b>Why it's useful: </b>Lets you shoot, pass, or fake after your first jump is already used.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Musty Flick</h3>
            <p><b>What it is: </b>A special flick where your car swings backward and launches the ball forward with a lot of power.</p>
            <p><b>How it Works: </b>You tilt your car backward underneath the ball, then backflip — the car's nose launches the ball upward.</p>
            <p><b>Why it's useful: </b>High, super powerful flicks that can beat defenders.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Wave Dash</h3>
            <p><b>What it is: </b>A way to "flip" forward without jumping, keeping your speed and control.</p>
            <p><b>How it Works: </b>You jump slightly, tilt your car back, then land your front wheels first and dodge forward on landing.</p>
            <p><b>Why it's useful: </b>Quick bursts of speed without using boost or leaving the ground too much.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Breezi Flick</h3>
            <p><b>What it is: </b>A very flashy flick where you spin your car 180 degrees while carrying the ball and flick it backward.</p>
            <p><b>How it Works: </b>You dribble, air roll into a 180 turn while popping the ball up, then backflip it toward the goal.</p>
            <p><b>Why it's useful: </b>Mostly a stylish move to flex — but can confuse defenders too!</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Zap Dash</h3>
            <p><b>What it is: </b>A new movement technique that lets you launch yourself forward without boost by canceling a dash and landing quickly.</p>
            <p><b>How it Works: </b>You dodge into the ground (usually off a wall or after a jump), cancel it midair, and the momentum launches you forward when you land.</p>
            <p><b>Why it's useful: </b>Crazy speed boost without using any boost — it's hard to master!</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Ceiling Shots</h3>
            <p><b>What it is: </b>You drive onto the ceiling and jump off to hit the ball in a creative way.</p>
            <p><b>How it Works: </b>You carry the ball up the wall, drive onto the ceiling, fall off, and use your flip to shoot.</p>
            <p><b>Why it's useful: </b>Forces defenders to react weirdly — especially strong when faking a shot or doing flip resets off it.</p>
